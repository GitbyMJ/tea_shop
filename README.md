# Tea Cozy Tea Shop

My completed Tea Shop project for the Front End Engineer career path on Codecademy!
For this project, I was challenged with building a website to a design spec utilizing the Flexbox method. I found this project extremely challenging, but very good practice for applying new skills on the fly. I want to return to this project in the future to update it to be more responsive to alternative screen sizes. For now, view the live website below:
